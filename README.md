# Spirit Island Helper
A pet project that I'm working for the board game [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island). It is intended to streamline the game by automating setup, building invader decks, fear counting, and blight reminders. It is not intended to replace the core game.
